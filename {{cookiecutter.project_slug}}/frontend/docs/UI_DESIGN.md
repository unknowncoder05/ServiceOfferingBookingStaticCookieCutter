# UI Design Guardrails

## Contrast-safe surfaces

Use the generated semantic utilities for normal application UI:

- `pm-surface-page` for page shells.
- `pm-surface-panel` for cards, modals, tables, sidebars, and forms.
- `pm-surface-muted` for secondary panels, list rows, inputs, and quiet controls.
- `pm-surface-inset` for selected rows, nested fields, and contained highlights.
- `pm-text-strong`, `pm-text`, `pm-text-muted`, and `pm-text-soft` for text placed on those surfaces.

These utilities are backed by CSS variables in `src/index.css` and switch with the `.dark` class. Prefer them over hand-pairing `bg-*` and `text-*` classes.

## Brand and status colors

Use brand or status colors for accents, small badges, icons, focus rings, and primary actions. Do not use a color scale as both the text and the large surface unless the light and dark mode contrast has been verified.

Safe examples:

- `bg-primary-600 text-white`
- `bg-danger-50 text-danger-700 dark:bg-danger-900/30 dark:text-danger-300`
- `pm-surface-panel pm-text`

Risky examples:

- `bg-primary-100 text-primary-200`
- `dark:bg-secondary-900 dark:text-secondary-800`
- `bg-white text-secondary-100`

## Required checks

Run `npm run ui:guardrails` before completing frontend work. It blocks raw color literals, likely large bright surfaces in dark mode, hard-coded JSX copy, and common low-contrast `bg-*` plus `text-*` class pairings.

Run `npm run test:contrast` for the reliable rendered check. It uses Playwright and axe-core's `color-contrast` rule on public pages in light and dark mode, then runs a computed-style scan over visible `input`, `textarea`, `select`, and `contenteditable` controls. The computed scan catches cases axe can miss, such as white input text on a white or transparent input background.

Add product-specific workflow routes with `E2E_EXTRA_CONTRAST_ROUTES=/assessment,/settings npm run test:contrast`. Use this for the main authenticated or demo flow before shipping.
